# Sparta

Welcome to Sparta, the Discord bot. It's like having a virtual assistant, but with less features and less judgment.

Here's a quick rundown of what this codebase is all about:

## What is Sparta?

Sparta is a Discord bot that lives to serve (and occasionally sass) testnet participants.

## Features (WIP)
  
- **Chain Info**: Need to know the latest on your blockchain? Sparta's got you covered with the `/get-info` command. It's like having a blockchain oracle, but without the cryptic riddles.

- **Add Validators**: Are you an S&P Participant and want to be added to the validator set? Just go `/validator add` and send your address, you can then query it with...

- **Check Validators**: ... `/validator check`, which tells you if you're in the validator set (also tells you if you're in the committee)

## Getting Started

To get Sparta up and running, you'll need to:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the dependencies with `bun install`.
3. Copy .env.example and set up with your environment stuff
4. Start the bot with `bun run start`.

And just like that, you're ready to unleash Sparta on your Discord server!
